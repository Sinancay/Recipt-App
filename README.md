# Recipt App

Basically recipt print application with JS and HTML5. I used Bootstrap framework for front part. This is just experiment for JS and HTML5 works.

```
git clone https://github.com/Python-Programming-Summer-2017/hw3-palindrome-Sinancay
```
Replace `Sinancay` with your actual Github user name.

In the repository, the file `american-english` is the dictionary file we will use. In this file, each line contains one English word.

Write a HTML5 (name the file `index.html`) 

Write a JS (name the file `main.js`)
